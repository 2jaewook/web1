            is an information system where documents and
            other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators
            (URLs, such as https://www.example.com/),
            which may be interlinked by hypertext,
            and are accessible over the Internet.[1]
            The resources of the WWW may be accessed by users
            by a software application called a web browser.
